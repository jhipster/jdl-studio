JDL-Studio
=======

Hello, this is [JDL-Studio](https://jhipster.github.io/jdl-studio/), a tool for drawing UML diagrams for [JHipster](https://jhipster.github.io) based on the [JDL syntax](https://jhipster.github.io/jhipster-uml/#jdl). It tries to keep its syntax visually as close as possible to the generated UML diagram without resorting to ASCII drawings.

Created by [Deepu KS](https://github.com/deepu105). Heavily inspired and adapted from  [nomnoml](https://github.com/skanaar/nomnoml)

### JDL-Studio was made possible by these cool projects

## Web application

The JDL-Studio web application is a simple editor with a live preview. It is purely client side and changes are saved to the browser's _localStorage_, so your diagram should be here the next time, (but no guarantees).

### Interaction

The canvas can be panned and zoomed by dragging and scrolling in the right hand third of the canvas. Downloaded image files will be given the filename in the `#title` directive.

### syntax

The JDL syntax is explained [here](https://jhipster.github.io/jdl/#jdllanguage).
